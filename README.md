# Projects

A collection of my personal coding projects and experiments. This repository contains various tools, scripts, and applications I've built for learning, exploration, and utility.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure
Each project is organized in its own folder for clarity. The folders contain:
- **Project-specific code**
- **Documentation or usage guides (if any)**
- **Related assets or data files**

### Current Projects
1. **Voice Note Taker**  
   A Python script that allows you to create voice notes using speech-to-text. Features include:
   - Audio input via microphone
   - Automatic text conversion and saving to a file
   - Easy-to-use interface

2. *(I'll be adding more projects here in the future...)*
